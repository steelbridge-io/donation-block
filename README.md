This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

Read the above documentation to become familiar with how to update this plugin.

Donation Block is developed as a conditional guten block where adding a title renders a collapsing/expanding 
container including a title, image and text.

Up to 10 containers included. Add more as your wish.
